**A DDQN-based Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation Scheme for Low-Latency V2V communication**

Juanjuan Miao, **Xinyue Chai**, Xiaoqin Song, Tiechen Song

[**Project**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9846189)

**Abstract** <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
This paper examines sidelink (SL) resource allocation for the new radio vehicle-to-everything (NR-V2X) technology based on 5G networks, focusing on Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication outside the coverage of 5G base stations. Using network slicing technology, V2V sidelinks utilize spectrum designated for ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC). To enhance energy efficiency and meet URLLC delay requirements, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architecture with centralized training and distributed execution. A model using Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) is trained to achieve these goals. Simulations show that our DDQN-based algorithm performs better in terms of energy efficiency and latency compared to other algorithms.

**Deep Q-learning Enabled Wireless Resource Allocation for 5G Network Based Vehicle-to-vehicle Communications**

Shumo Wang, **Xinyue Chai**, Xiaoqin Song, Xin Liang

[**Project**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9689007)

**Abstract** <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is essential for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), requiring effective cooperation among vehicles. The main challenge is ensuring reliable transmission under latency conditions. This paper explores wireless resource allocation for 5G-based V2V communication, using network slicing to differentiate between V2V and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. Formulating reliable transmission and latency constraints into optimization problems is difficult, so we use deep Q-learning for resource allocation. In our framework, each V2V link acts as an agent, learning to select sub-channels and transmission power through a designed reward system and training mechanism. Simulations show that V2V links can ensure successful message transmission while maximizing overall capacity.

**VibroBot: A Wearable and Programmable Vibration Bot for Multichannel Tactile Guidance**

**Introduction** <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
VibroBot is an innovative tactile interaction device designed to provide unique user experiences through multichannel tactile feedback. Each VibroBot weighs just 2.9 grams, making it lightweight yet powerful. It uses wireless communication to receive programmable signals, delivering six distinguishable vibration feedback patterns in real-time to guide precise finger movements. When worn on all five fingers, VibroBot works collaboratively to help users adjust each finger, achieving perfect hand gesture control. With VibroBot's guidance, users can perform accurate grabbing actions in virtual environments, correct gesture errors, and improve operational precision and efficiency.

**Lily's Night ：Arduino sensor-based somatosensory games**

[**Project**](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Pa4y1f7C8/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=3fe344ae0b27126cbc716211cffe4197)

**Introduction** <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
"Lily's Night" is a sensor game based on Arduino ultrasonic, the game is about a young man named Lily, in an attempt to jump off a building to commit suicide, from the heart burst out of the desire to survive, the player plays the falling Lily, through the climb to obtain the possibility of survival. The game aims to urge people to care more about their own mental health as well as those around them. The game is developed based on Unity3D game engine and Arduino ultrasonic sensor.

**Draw And Play ：Interactive Drawing Educational Tools**

**Introduction** <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
"Draw And Play" is an interactive game for children's drawing education. Existing drawing education emphasizes on color matching and drawing skills. In order to stimulate children's higher interest in drawing, this interactive game is developed, where children can use brushes to draw on the computer, and then based on the camera's motion capture, children can interact with the handwriting, which will stimulate more creativity. The project is developed based on Unity game engine and Mediapipe framework.

**Remote Operation System of Robotic Arm Based On Inertial Motion-capture Gloves**

**Introduction** <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
This project focuses on developing a remote operation system for a robotic arm, leveraging the capabilities of MANUS motion capture gloves and a Realsense camera. The system captures the position and rotation information of the gloves through the Realsense camera, enabling precise control of the robotic arm's end effector. Additionally, the bending information from the motion capture gloves is used to control the finger movements of the robotic hand, allowing for intricate and accurate remote grasping and manipulation tasks.By integrating these advanced technologies, the system provides a seamless interface for operators to perform complex tasks from a distance, enhancing precision and efficiency in remote environments.
