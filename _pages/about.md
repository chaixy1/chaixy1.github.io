[A DDQN-based Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation Scheme for Low-Latency V2V communication](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)

**Abstract** <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
This paper examines sidelink (SL) resource allocation for the new radio vehicle-to-everything (NR-V2X) technology based on 5G networks, focusing on Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication outside the coverage of 5G base stations. Using network slicing technology, V2V sidelinks utilize spectrum designated for ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC). To enhance energy efficiency and meet URLLC delay requirements, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architecture with centralized training and distributed execution. A model using Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) is trained to achieve these goals. Simulations show that our DDQN-based algorithm performs better in terms of energy efficiency and latency compared to other algorithms.

[Deep Q-learning Enabled Wireless Resource Allocation for 5G Network Based Vehicle-to-vehicle Communications](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)

**Abstract** <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is essential for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), requiring effective cooperation among vehicles. The main challenge is ensuring reliable transmission under latency conditions. This paper explores wireless resource allocation for 5G-based V2V communication, using network slicing to differentiate between V2V and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. Formulating reliable transmission and latency constraints into optimization problems is difficult, so we use deep Q-learning for resource allocation. In our framework, each V2V link acts as an agent, learning to select sub-channels and transmission power through a designed reward system and training mechanism. Simulations show that V2V links can ensure successful message transmission while maximizing overall capacity.
